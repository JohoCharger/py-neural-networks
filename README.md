# _Neural Networks in Python_ (WIP)

### This repository contains the python code created during my learning progress of implementing neural networks from ground up.

This was done because I'm currently developing an AI completely in rust, but due to Rust's immaturity in the field 
of AI, I decided to implement the neural network in python and then translate it to rust.
